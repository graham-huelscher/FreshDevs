The 'dotenv' package was used to provide the database login and password securely to the Db config. Please contact me on the slack and I will add you as a user to the database, which will provide you with your own username and password to pass into the Db config.

the .env file is in the format of:

MongoAtlasId = 'yourid'

MongoAtlasPassword = 'yourpassword'
